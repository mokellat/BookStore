An online bookstore

Certainly! Here's a project challenge with defined tasks and features for you to code using the technologies you mentioned:

Project: Online Bookstore

Description:
Build a web application for an online bookstore. The application should allow users to browse, search, and purchase books. Users should be able to create accounts, add books to their shopping carts, and complete the checkout process.

Tasks:

1. Set up the project:
   - Initialize a new Angular or React project.
   - Configure the project structure and dependencies.
   - Set up a PostgreSQL database and establish a connection.

2. User Management:
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Allow users to view and update their profile information.
   - Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain features.

3. Book Catalog:
   - Create a database schema to store book information (title, author, genre, price, etc.) using PostgreSQL.
   - Implement APIs or database queries to retrieve and display book information.
   - Design a user-friendly interface to browse and search for books using Angular or React.

4. Shopping Cart:
   - Develop functionality to add books to a user's shopping cart.
   - Implement the ability to update the quantity or remove items from the cart.
   - Calculate the total price of the items in the cart.

5. Checkout Process:
   - Create a secure payment gateway integration (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) for processing payments.
   - Develop the checkout process, including entering shipping and billing information.
   - Generate order confirmation and display it to the user.

6. Deployment and Infrastructure:
   - Set up GitLab CI pipelines to automate the build and deployment processes.
   - Utilize Nexus as a repository manager to manage project dependencies.
   - Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Use Ansible for automated deployment and configuration management.

Remember to break down each task into smaller subtasks as necessary. This project challenge incorporates all the technologies you mentioned and covers various aspects of building an online bookstore. Feel free to modify or add additional features based on your preferences and requirements. Good luck with your coding challenge!
